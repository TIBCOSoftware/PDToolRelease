==================================
Section 2:
Known Issues:
==================================

- (Windows) JQuery does not seem to play nice with Internet Explorer 11. Unknown issue is causing IE to become
  non-responsive when certain pages load. Not able to get IE's tools to reveal what the problem is. Rolling IE
  back to version 10 fixes the issue.
  
- (Windows) Progress dialog for execute and VCS initialization will sometimes repeat the same blocks of log
  information multiple times. This generally happens when the host system is under load. Does not affect the
  execution of ExecutePDTool.

- (All platforms) Array, list, and map set buttons don't seem to fire click events properly when the top of the
  form is above the top edge of the browser window. This happens in both Firefox and IE. For some reason clicking
  the set button puts the focus on the first input field in the form, instead of opening the value editor dialog.
  Not sure why focus is being moved instead of a click event firing.

Section 3:
Release Notes (newest first):
==================================

======================
Release Beta 2:
======================
1) Execution log file names now contain the file name of the plan being executed.

2) Fixed an issue with the deployment plan editor where new plans would get the first row repeated across all rows
   until the plan editor page was refreshed.
   
3) Fixed an issue where the data source editor page would write out data source map attribute without the value map
   element. This would cause PDTool to exit with an error.

4) Fixed an issue with the plan editor check to see if the plan file is empty.

5) Fixed an issue where a null pointer exception would be thrown when the plan editor attempted to interpolate variables
   in a file path that were unset.

6) The privilege editor did not set a default value for "update dependencies" with add privilege.

7) Updated new module fields and methods for PDTool releases since the 2014-04-12 release.

8) Server ID is no longer common to all module methods. Removed it as a hard coded field and set it up to be built
   dynamically with all the other method parameters in the plan editor.

9) Other miscellaneous fixes.
