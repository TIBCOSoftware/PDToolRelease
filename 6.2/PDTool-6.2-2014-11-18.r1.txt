Section 2:
Release Notes (newest first):
==================================

======================
Release 2014-11-18:
======================
1) Enhanced ResourceModule executeProcedure and executeConfiguredProcedures(mtinius):
	a) Added the ability to print to the console window and log the procedure output variables.
		The same procedure is overloaded with a new parameter "outputReturnVariables" [optional].
			true=output the values of the return variables from the procedure call to the console/log.
			false=do not output the return variable values.
		Limitations:
			* This method only supports all scalar values or one cursor output.
			* This method does not support procedure calls with no output.
			* This method does not support procedure calls with mixed scalar and cursor output.
			* This method has been enhanced to print out the result scalar values or cursor output.
2) Updated the license in all files.
	
======================
Release 2014-08-25:
======================
1) Enhanced log4j Debugging (mtinius):
	a) Added more informative debug messages for each invocation to CIS where "port.method_name" is referenced.   This will allows developers/users to see
		exactly what is being passed into CIS.  it also provides the ability to determine if exceptions occur as a result of PDTool or CIS.  There are 
		success statements placed directly after each CIS invocation.  To turn on a high-level of debugging modify /resourcs/config/log4j.properties as shown below:
			# PDTool Module Debugging for Command-line and Ant (Applies to *ALL* Modules)
			log4j.logger.com.cisco.dvbu.ps.deploytool=DEBUG
			# Common Utility Framework Debugging includes:
			# [CommonUtils, PropertyManager, PropertyUtil, ScriptExecutor, XMLUtils, JdbcConnector]
			log4j.logger.com.cisco.dvbu.ps.common.util=DEBUG

2) Added additional documentation (mtinius):
	a) Added PDTool Training powerpoints using Cisco format
		01 PDTool Training - Introduction v2.0.pptx
		02 PDTool Training - PDTool Studio Version Control v2.0.pptx
		03 PDTool Training - Deployment v2.0.pptx
		04 PDTool Training - Testing v2.0.pptx
		05 PDTool Training - VCS Multi-Tenant v2.0.pptx
		
======================
Release 2014-07-10:
======================
1) VCS Module (mtinius):
	a) Added an exception from VCS Diff Merger method when a path cannot be found.  Prefixed error with "Application Error:".
	b) Removed the text ending with "ApplicationException" from errors that are supposed to be ignored so that the log can be parsed for actual errors.

2) ExecutePDTool.bat (mtinius):
	a) Modified so that any error that comes from the batch file is prefixed consistently by "Execution Failed::".  This will make the log easier to parse.
	
3) Parsing a log file for errors.
	Parse the log file for the following text in this order:
		"Application Error:"					-- Comes from Diff Merger method
		"CompositeException:"					-- Comes from java code exception
		"ApplicationException:"					-- Comes from java code exception
		"ValidationException:"					-- Comes from java code exception
		"Execution Failed::"					-- Comes from batch file exception
			
======================
Release 2014-06-30:
======================
1) VCS Module (mtinius):
	a) Resolved issue where VCS archive import, export and diffmerger were not being written to app.log.
	b) Throw an exception when diffmerger determines a path "could not be located".   This could be a mis-configuration by the deployment person.
	
2) Regression Module (mtinius):
	a) Fixed bug where any white space found after a query and before a separator [QUERY], [PROCEDURE], or [WEB_SERVICE] caused the query parser to interpret many queries as a single query.
		This resulted in the execution of the query failing.
	b) Added the parameter "outputFilename" to the regression input file.  This will provided a way of identifying an output file name for queries that contain subqueries.  Prior
		to this, PDTool made a best effort to construct the filename from the "FROM" clause.  However, when a subquery is used in the "FROM" clause there is no way to decipher a
		filename from that query.
	c) Documented the concept of a Query Governor for [QUERY] and [PROCEDURE].  Use SELET TOP n <column-list> FROM <CATALOG.SCHEMA.VIEW|PROCEDURE> within the regression input file.
		This requires modifying any generated queries to add the TOP command.
		
======================
Release 2014-06-13:
======================
1) VCS Module (mtinius):
	a) vcsInitializeBaseFolderCheckin - providing support for <TYPE=DATABASE> and [TYPE=DATABASE], <TYPE=CATALOG> and [TYPE=CATALOG], <TYPE=SCHEMA> and [TYPE=SCHEMA]
	b) Updated method vcsScanPathLength and vcsScanPathLength2 to pass in an additional parameter vcsMaxPathLength which is used to compare against the length of the path.
	   If the max path length passed in is zero then set it to the default max windows path length. 
	   If the max path length passed in is greater than the max windows path length then set it to the default max windows path length.

2) Regression Module (mtinius):
	a) Fixed issue where baseDir was not being created when different patterns of slashes were used like C:\\tmp/pdtool\functest.
	b) Fixed issue where SQL text from input file was not formatted properly when it occurs on multiple lines.  Newline characters are replaced with spaces prior to display or execution.

3) deploy.properties - Added variable "propertyOrderPrecedence" in order to give the user control over the precedence of order in which variables are retrieved.
	The property order of precedence defines which properties are retrieved in what order.
	   JVM - These are properties that are set on the JVM command line with a -DVAR=value
	   PROPERTY_FILE - These are the variables set in the configuration property file like deploy.properties or in the VCSModule.xml
	   SYSTEM - These are variables that are set in batch files in the operating system prior to invocation of PDTool.
	 If left blank, the default=JVM PROPERTY_FILE SYSTEM
	 However, it may be necessary to be able to override what is in the property file and pick up an environment variable first.
	 propertyOrderPrecedence=JVM SYSTEM PROPERTY_FILE

======================
Release 2014-05-28:
======================
1) Server List-servers.xml (mtinius):
	a) added attribute <allowVariables>true|false</allowVariables> to control whether variables should be used or not in order to force
	   backward compability with previously releases.  Resolves issue with 2014-05-19 release where there was no choice which disrupted
	   passwords containing $ or % in them.  Now the user can decide whether all attributes or no attributes can have variables.  If
	   allowVariables=true then <encryptedPassword> may "not" have the values $ or % in them unless they are variables.
	   
1) VCS Module (mtinius):
	a) Externalized the CIS Import and Export options.  Modified the schema PDToolModules.xsd.
	   This allows more flexibility in controlling what happens during VCS CIS import/export operations.  For example, the default behavior during
	   import is to add the import option: -includeaccess.  However, if the user does not have privileges to modify users, then the command will fail.  
	   This provides the user with the ability to set the options according to access.
	   
	   Added VCS_CIS_IMPORT_OPTIONS to deploy.properties and VCSModule.xml
		# VCS Resource Import Options:
		#   Occurs during a vcsCheckout when the temporary checkout.car file is imported into the target server.
		#   The import is the final step in the process.  The backwards compatible option is to include access: -includeaccess 
		#   Consult the Archive Module documentation for more options.
		VCS_CIS_IMPORT_OPTIONS=-includeaccess

	   Added VCS_CIS_EXPORT_OPTIONS to deploy.properties and VCSModule.xml
		# VCS Resource Export Options:
		#   Occurs during a vcsCheckin when the temporary checkout.car file is exported from the target server.
		#   The export from the target is used to compare resources against the VCS repository.  The backwards compatible option is leave this option blank.
		#   Consult the Archive Module documentation for more options.
		VCS_CIS_EXPORT_OPTIONS=
		
	b) Added VCS_BASE_TYPE to both deploy.properties and VCSModule.xml
		Recommended options=[SVN, CVS, P4, or TFS]. Choose to coincide with VCS_TYPE.
		This can be used as a default option when constructing the VCS_WORKSPACE_NAME and VCS_TEMP_DIR name.

======================
Release 2014-05-19:
======================
1) VCS Module (mtinius):
	a) Added the ability to set/extract variables from TFS_SERVER_URL and the VCS_Module.xml variables.
	b) Added the ability /bin/setVars.bat to invoke a separate setMyVars.bat file in the users home directory for presonal variable settings.
	c) Added checks for substitute drive in ExecutePDTool.bat and ExecutePDToolStudio.bat.
	d) Added new method vcsScanPathLength and vcsScanPathLength2 which is used to report paths in CIS that are longer than 259 characters.
	   This is mainly an issue for TFS and not subversion.  Subversion is able to handle the long file names with no issues.
	   This method helps the developers to uncover issues in CIS prior to checking in resources.   
	   This should be run by a senior developer who has access to PDTool as PDToolStudio does not support this feature.
	e) Added the ability to set variables for all servers.xml atttributes.  Note if a password contains a $ or % then a variable cannot be used 
	   for the <encryptedPassword> attribute.
	   
======================
Release 2014-04-12:
======================
1) VCS Module (mtinius):
	a) Added the ability to initialize the VCS with the Composite repository base folders and custom CIS folders.
	   Supported in this release: Subversion, TFS, Perforce
	   Not supported in this release: CVS
	   The use cases for this feature support multi-tenant environments or CIS repository installations where there
	   are 10s of 1000s of resources and not all resources will be placed under version control.  The base-level
	   folders are mandatory when establishing the VCS repository.  Without these folders being properly checked-in, 
	   the check-out process will not work properly.  The traditional way of approaching this was to check-in root (/)
	   to insure all base-level folders were checked in.  However, the downside to this is that then entire Composite
	   repository was also checked in.  This may not be desirable if there are 10s of 1000s of resources.  The other
	   requirement is that all intermediate folders leading up to the actual tenant folder must be checked in.  The only
	   way that this could have been done in the past was to check-in starting at that folder which in turn would check in
	   all folders within that path.  If there were other tenant folders within that path, they would also be checked in.
	   
	   The following two methods have been added to PDTool to provide the flexibility for initializing the VCS repository
	   with base-level folders and custom CIS folders.
	   public void vcsInitializeBaseFolderCheckin(String customPathList, String vcsUser, String vcsPassword) throws CompositeException 
	   public void vcsInitializeBaseFolderCheckin(String vcsConnectionId, String customPathList, String pathToVcsXML, String vcsUser, String vcsPassword) throws CompositeException 
	   
	   The following element was added to PDToolModules.xsd:  <VCS_BASE_FOLDER_INIT_ADD></VCS_BASE_FOLDER_INIT_ADD>

	   
======================
Release 2014-03-26:
======================
1) [Required]: Upgrade existing XML Files
	a) For all releases prior to 2014-03-12, modify the XML namespace from www.compositesw.com to www.dvbu.cisco.com
		i) Before:  xmlns:p1="http://www.compositesw.com/ps/deploytool/modules"
		ii) After:  xmlns:p1="http://www.dvbu.cisco.com/ps/deploytool/modules"
		
	b) For the 2014-03-12 release modify the XML Files namespace from www.cisco.dvbu.com to www.dvbu.cisco.com:
		i) Before:  xmlns:p1="http://www.cisco.dvbu.com/ps/deploytool/modules"
		ii) After:  xmlns:p1="http://www.dvbu.cisco.com/ps/deploytool/modules"
	
2) Source clean-up
	a) Removed @override from all source as it was causing compilation errors with the new version of Eclipse.
	b) Placed RepoUtils.properties in the /bin and removed from /lib
	
3) Archive Module - Variable processing.
	a) Added variable processing for ArchiveModule.xml.
	b) Added "debug3" check to output archive command line when deploy.properties DEBUG3=true
	
======================
Release 2014-03-12:
======================
1) Open Source Release (mtinius)
	a) Prepared PDTool for open source.  
	b) Changed package names from com.compositesw to com.cisco.dbvu
	c) Modified XML Schema Target Namespace to xmlns:p1="http://www.cisco.dvbu.com/ps/deploytool/modules"
	d) Changed distribution jar file name from CisDeployTool.jar to PDTool.jar.
	e) Changed XML Schema jar from CisDeployToolModules.jar to PDToolModules.jar
	f) Updated documentation.
	
2) [Required]: Upgrade existing XML Files
	a) The XML Namespace must be changed from www.compositesw.com to www.cisco.dvbu.com
		i) Before:  xmlns:p1="http://www.compositesw.com/ps/deploytool/modules"
		ii) After:  xmlns:p1="http://www.cisco.dvbu.com/ps/deploytool/modules"
	
3) Regression Module (mtinius) - Added security testing capability.
	a) Added new functionality (executeSecurityTest and generateRegressionSecurityXML) capabilities.

4) Privilege Module (mtinius) - Added support for new parameter.
	a) updateDependenciesRecursively - If "true", then all dependencies of the given resources will recursively be updated with the privileges assigned to their parent.
	
5) VCS Module (mtinius) - Added fix for filename/path too long issue.
	a) Resolved issue when running PDTool in windows and the path names are longer than 259 characters. Resolved for subversion and TFS.  Has not been resolved for Perforce or CVS.
	b) Caveat:  Since TFS is built on windows, TFS itself contains the 259 character limitation and therefore, it will still throw errors.  This is a known problem with TFS.
	
6) VCS Module (mtinius) - Added additional command line option variables for workspace initialization, checkin and checkout
	a) Options were added to deploy.properties, studio.properties and VCSModule.xml file.
	b) PDToolModule.xsd was modified to support additional properties
	c) List of property additions include:
		# Workspace Initialization.  Create new workspace: 				VCS_WORKSPACE_INIT_NEW_OPTIONS=
		# Workspace Initialization.  Link workspace to VCS repository: 	VCS_WORKSPACE_INIT_LINK_OPTIONS=
		# Workspace Initialization.  Get resources from VCS repository: VCS_WORKSPACE_INIT_GET_OPTIONS=
		# Resource Checkin. Checkin resources to VCS: 					VCS_CHECKIN_OPTIONS=
		# Resource Checkin Required. Checkin resources to VCS: 			VCS_CHECKIN_OPTIONS_REQUIRED=
		# Resource Checkout. Checkout resources to VCS: 				VCS_CHECKOUT_OPTIONS=
		# Resource Checkout Required. Checkout resources to VCS: 		VCS_CHECKOUT_OPTIONS_REQUIRED=
	d) Added validation for VCS_TYPE.  Allowed values=SVN, P4, CVS, TFS2005, TFS2010, TFS2012, TFS2013

7) DEPRECATED: The property TFS_CHECKIN_OPTIONS has been deprecated.  Use VCS_CHECKIN_OPTIONS instead.

8) All modules (mtinius) - extended support for variables.
	a) Added support for extracting variables from the module id in a deployment plan.
	b) Added support for variables in various resource paths from different module XML.

======================
Release 2014-02-04:
======================
1) Regression Module (ssternin) - Resolved issue where file checksum is different on two files where the result rows are the same but in a different order.
	SQL does not guarantee order of results.  File checksum is now calculated on a row-by-row basis and summed up for two files and then the overall checksum is compared.  

2) Resource Cache Module (mtinius) - Provided an enhancement (updateResourceCacheEnabled) method that will enable/disable all configured caches
	for a given starting resource path.  The method will recursively walk the starting folder and sub-folders, interrogate existing configured caches and 
	set the enable flag according to how the flag is configured in the ResourceCacheModule.xml.

3) Archive Module (cgoodrich) - Resolved ability to use -nosourceinfo flag.
	When exporting a wsdl/soap data source with –nosourceinfo. Attributes (like certificates) specified in the advanced tab are retained on import to a target env. 
	The target CIS Server must be patched to at least 6.2.5.00.24 which allows the pkg_import flag -nosourceinfo to work properly to leave out certificates.  
	The flag in PDTool is called Includesourceinfo=true/false.

4) VCS Module, Archive Module (cgoodrich) - Ability to login using https (PDTool over SSL).
	Updated PDTool jar files with the jars from 6.2.5.  Tested backward connectivity to 6.2.3.
	Added security option trustStore setting to setVars.bat and setVars.sh which is to be enabled when connecting with https.
	Documented steps for enabling HTTPS connectivity using PDTool.  Server configuration is required.  CIS Server patching may be required. 
	Requires CIS to be patched to 6.2.4.00.46 or higher for the resetNamespace to work properly.

5) PDTool over SSL (https) (cgoodrich/mtinus) - 
	Modified /bin/setVars.bat and setVars.sh to include CERT_ARGS setting defaulted to weak trustStore included with PDTool.
	Updated the Installation Guide.

6) HTTP Proxy (tonyoung, mtinius) - Updated batch files to support HTTP Proxy.
	Modified /bin/setVars.bat and setVars.sh to include HTTP_PROXY in the JAVA_OPT settings.
	Updated the Installation Guide.
	
7) VCS Module (mtinius) - Validated VCONN ID and printed VCONN debug info.
	a. When the VCONN ID is not found in the VCSModule.xml, it was defaulting to connection information in deploy.properties.
		This in general is not good because this could produce undesired results.  It will now throw an error when VCONN ID is not found.
		That issue also resulted in the VCS_OPTIONS containing repeated username and passwords for subsequent executions in a row.
		This was fixed by virtue of not allowing the code to proceed unless a valid VCONN ID was found.
	b. Print our debug information for VCONN ID.
	c. Added validation for VCS_TYPE.  Allowed values=SVN, P4, CVS, TFS2005, TFS2010, TFS2012

8) Archive Module (mtinius) - Default ArchiveModule.xml <encrypt> flag to true when servers.xml <useHttps> flag is true.
	By overriding the encrypt flag and setting to true when useHttps=true, it provides a consistent interface for the user otherwise the user
	will have to set both flags to true when PDTool over SSL (https) is being used.  An exception is thrown during Archive Module operations
	when encrypt=false and useHttps=true.  When useHttps=false, the encrypt flag is used as it is defined in the ArchiveModule.xml file.
	
9) Trigger Module (cgoodrich, mtinius) - Fixed issue where start time was not being generated for mode=NONE (Exactly Once).

10) All Modules (mtinius) - Print out "Server Info" consistently for all modules and methods.

11) Regression Module (mtinius) - Web Service with no input params and HTTPS access
	a. Fixed issue where default string of "null" was output to the regression input file when generating web service entries in the input file.
	b. When connecting over HTTPS defaulted the regression input file "encrypt" flag to true when servers.xml useHttps=true.
	c. Added the resources filter to createRegressionInputFile method.
	d. Fixed resources filter comparison to use equal when no wildcard is present and startsWith when a wildcard "*" is present.

======================
Release 2013-12-10:
======================
1) All Modules (mkazia) - General capability to login to PDTool using https.

2) Regression Module (mtinius) - Resolved input file generation with complex SQL.  Resolved database objects with embedded spaces and periods.

======================
Release 2013-09-09:
======================
Author: mtinius
1) DataSource Module - Introspection enhancement and updated documentation.

	introspectDataSources - Introspect Data Source method introspects data sources for the passed in data source ids list found 
		in the the passed in datasources.xml file for the target server Id.  The method allows the invoker to add, update or remove resources.
		The use case is relavent when the target catalog/schema is different than the one defined in the source system.
		
																______ Different schema name for the different environments
															   |
															   v
		Example:  	DEV: 	/shared/MyProject/MY_DS/MY_SCHEMA_DEV/MY_TABLE
					TEST:	/shared/MyProject/MY_DS/MY_SCHEMA_TST/MY_TABLE
					PROD:	/shared/MyProject/MY_DS/MY_SCHEMA_PRD/MY_TABLE
					
					Solution: Use introspectDataSources.  
					The following DataSourceMdule.xml entry example adds MY_TABLE to the production schema:
					<datasource>
						<introspectDataSource>
							<id>ds7</id>
							<resourcePath>/shared/MyProject/MY_DS</resourcePath>
							<!--Element runInBackgroundTransaction is optional-->
							<runInBackgroundTransaction>false</runInBackgroundTransaction>
							<reportDetail>FULL</reportDetail>
							<plan>
								<updateAllIntrospectedResources>true</updateAllIntrospectedResources>
								<failFast>true</failFast>
								<commitOnFailure>true</commitOnFailure>
								<autoRollback>true</autoRollback>
								<scanForNewResourcesToAutoAdd>false</scanForNewResourcesToAutoAdd>
								<!--Element planEntry is optional-->
								<planEntry>
									<resourceId>
										<resourcePath>MY_SCHEMA_PRD/MY_TABLE</resourcePath>
										<resourceType>TABLE</resourceType>
										<subtype>DATABASE_TABLE</subtype>
									</resourceId>
									<action>ADD_OR_UPDATE</action>
								</planEntry>		
							</plan>
						</introspectDataSource>
					</datasource>

	generateDataSourceAttributeDefs - Generate Data Source Attribute Definitions for the passed in starting path and the target server Id.
		The method allows the invoker generate a file of data source attribute definitions.  This method will be useful when the user wants to determine what
		valid attributes are available for a given data source.
		
	generateDataSourceAttributeDefsByDataSourceType - Generate Data Source Attribute Definitions for the passed in data source type and the target server Id.
		The method allows the invoker generate a file of data source attribute definitions.  This method will be useful when the user wants to determine what
		valid attributes are available for a given data source.
		
	generateDataSourceTypes - Generate Data Source Types for the Composite Server.
		The method allows the invoker generate a file of data source types for the Composite Server.
		
	generateDataSourcesResourceListXML - Generate Data Sources Resource List for a starting path and target server Id will export all of the Data Sources found and their children.
		This will be useful to know the type and subtype for a particular data source child when constructing the "plan" entries for the 
		"introspectDataSources" method.

2) Privilege Module - Fixed documentation bug
3) Regression Module - Enhanced documention

======================
Release 2013-05-09:
======================
Author: mtinius
1) Regression Module - fixed bug
	Fixed a bug where the generated select statement in the input file did not have double quotes around resources
	containing spaces, special characters or reserved words.  The query would fail without the double quotes.
		e.g. select count(1) cnt from "_CAT"."1SCH"."customer orders"

2) Resource Module - added methods: 
	createFolder - Create all folders in the path associated with passed in resource path.
	createFolders -Create all folders in the path associated with the passed in resource ids.
	The deployToolModules.xsd (ResourceModule was modified to add an optional element "recursive" to the schema.
	
3) DataSource Module - added support for attributes containing ValueArray, ValueList, and ValueMap
	CIS 6.2 provides Data Ship Join which uses has an attributed named "DBLinkList" which uses a ValueMap.
	The deployToolModules.xsd DataSourceModule was modified to expand the definition of genericAttributes which are
	defined by AttributeDefType.  The "value" element was made optional.  The following elements were added to the schema:
		ValueArray
		ValueList
		ValueMap

4) In general, the deployToolModules.xsd has been modified but there is no impact to existing Module XML schemas as the modifications
   to the schema were made with optional settings.  Existing Module XML files will work with this changed schema.  It is important
   to have this new schema present in the upgraded PDTool directory.  Follow, the upgrade procedure outlined below.

======================
Release 2013-04-18:
======================
Author: mtinius
1) no changes - PDToolStudio only

======================
Release 2013-03-01:
======================
Author: mtinius
1) Added ResourceModule.getUsedResources() - used by RebindModule.
2) RebindModule - modified the rebindFolder() capability to allow any "rebindable" rebindable resource.
   Rebindable resources include, Views (TABLE), Procedures (Packaged, SQL Script, XSLT).
   The "rebindFolder" method provide the ability to rebind the resources in an entire folder to another folder.
   For example, a folder of physical views may point to a physical data source in DEV but the name of the
   data source is different in TEST and PROD.  The rebindFolder allows the deployer to rebind the entire folder
   in one deployment operation.  
3) Regression Scripts - updated the scripts to test all Rebind Module scenarios.

======================
Release 2013-02-15:
======================
Author: mtinius
1) Created scripts for Windows and UNIX to perform automated regression testing on PDTool.  
   Currently they are considered Composite internal and not included in the distribution zip file.
   
2) Modified the Regression Module to allow variables to be used in all elements of the RegressionModule.xml
   except <perfTestThreads>, <perfTestDuration>, <perfTestSleepPrint>, and <perfTestSleepExec> 
   because they are defined as xs:integer.

======================
Release 2013-01-14:
======================
Author: mtinius
1) Modified deployment configuration files to account for different CIS versions so that when testing is done
   the versions are not mixed for ArchiveModule and VCSModule.

     /resources/config/
	deploy.properties - 
		CIS_VERSION=6_2
		VCS_REPOSITORY_URL=http:////host.composite.com/svn/sandbox/PDTOOL/$CIS_VERSION

     /resources/carfiles/
	TEST00_5_2.car
	TEST00_6_0.car
	TEST00_6_1.car
	TEST00_6_2.car
	Regression_Test_5_2.car
	Regression_Test_6_0.car
	Regression_Test_6_1.car
	Regression_Test_6_2.car
	
     /resources/modules/
	VCSModule.xml - CIS_VERSION
		<VCS_REPOSITORY_URL>http:////host.composite.com/svn/sandbox/PDTOOL/$CIS_VERSION</VCS_REPOSITORY_URL>
	RegressionModule.xml - Web service queries
	
     /resources/modules/test/ - readme.txt
     /resources/plans/ - UnitTest-Regression.dp, UnitTest-All-Modules.dp

2) Fixed issue where DataSourceModule and ArchiveModule can only access a physical drive and not a virutal windows drive	

     /bin/ExecutePDTool.bat, ExecutePDTool.sh - added PROJECT_HOME_PHYSICAL
     /resources/modules/
	ArchiveModule.xml - CIS_VERSION, PROJECT_HOME_PHYSICAL
	DataSourceModule.xml - PROJECT_HOME_PHYSICAL
		
======================
Release 2012-10-29:
======================
Author: mtinius
1) Updated VCS code to take into account resource type when doing a check-in.
   Coincides with (SUP-13075) VCS checkin process attempts to check in the wrong resource when multiple.
   No PDTool configuration changes are required.
	
======================
Release 2012-10-08:
======================
Author: mtinius
1) Fixed Regression Module to properly generate the regression input file for the New Composite Web Services.
   Handles soap11 and soap12 including BARE and WRAPPED input parameters
   Note: PDTool will throw an exception if it detects the scenario where the Composite Web Service is configured for BARE
         and the invoked procedure contains multiple input parameters.  The user must configure WRAPPED input when using
         multiple input parameters.

# CIS_PING_SERVER:  Allows the user to control whether the server performs a ping on CIS prior to executing the actual command.
#                   The default is true if this variable is not set or does not exist.  This will override all settings.
CIS_PING_SERVER=false
#
# CIS_CONNECT_RETRY: Allows the user to set the number of retries to connect to CIS before throwing an error.
#                    The default is 1 if this variable is not set or does not exist.
CIS_CONNECT_RETRY=3
#
# CIS_CONNECT_RETRY_SLEEP: Number of milliseconds to sleep on connection retry
CIS_CONNECT_RETRY_SLEEP_MILLIS=5000

======================
Release 2012-08-15:

      Requires the http URL to have 4 forward slashes: VCS_REPOSITORY_URL=http:////host.composite.com/svn/sandbox

======================
Release 2012-07-24:
======================
1) ArchiveModule:
   a) Added both -includeusers and -mergeusers 
   a) Added to Archive module the capabilities provided by -includeusers and -mergeusers options of pkg_import. 
      You can now add <import> node into the <users> specifying one of two options -- "overwrite" or "merge" --  corresponding to the above command-line parameters.
		<users>
			<export>
				<domain>domain_name</domain>
			</export>
			<import>overwrite</import>
		</users>

	a) Modified ExecutePDTool.bat (windows only) to address the "file too long" problem for all VCS implementations.
	b) Use a SUBST variable v: to assist in shortening the path
				  
4) Archive Module has implemented the rest of the import/export options.
    a) The ArchiveModule.xml has added several new elements so compare your XML with the example in the /resources/modules directory.

======================
Release 2012-06-08:
======================
1) TriggerModule
    a) Fixed issue with recurringDay check.  Threw error on 1.  now works for values between 1 and 127.
2) VCSModule:
    a) Allow no username and password to be set in the deploy.properties, VCSModule.xml or the command line.
       This allows a user to use the cached credentials in the filesystem when executing a VCS command.
       An error will still be thrown by the VCS server if the user credentials have not been established.
       A user must first establish their credential outside of PD Tool prior to executing PD Tool commands for the first time.
    b) Allow properties to contain $$ within the text which is converted to $.  
       This is useful for URLS that contain a $ in the URL like http://localhost:port/$/repo/project

3) Added JAVA_OPT with min and max memory settings to ExecutePDTool.bat, ExecutePDTool.sh, and ExecutePDToolStudio.bat

======================
Release 2012-02-22:
======================
1) Fixed issue with p4 submit.  Command set as follows: p4 submit -d "<message> .//<cis-resource-path>"
2) Enhancement: added VCS_MESSAGE_PREPEND which allows the user to prepend a static message onto the message that gets passed in.
     Added VCS_MESSAGE_PREPEND deploy.property and studio.property
     Added <VCS_MESSAGE_PREPEND></VCS_MESSAGE_PREPEND> to VCSModule.xml -- modified CisDeployToolModule.xsd

3) Fixed issue with 01/31 build not being able to login and perform ArchiveModule import or export.
4) Fixed oversight where $VCONN variable (example) was missing from deploy.property and example property files

To Upgrade an existing install:
Copy the following from the new distribution to your existing PD Tool installation
1.  /dist/CisDeployTool.jar
2.  /docs/*
3.  /lib/CisDeployToolModules.jar
4. /resources/schema/*
5. Edit /resources/config/deploy.properties (and any other deploy properties that you have) and add the following text after VCS_IGNORE_MESSAGES
#
#-------------------
# VCS_MESSAGE_PREPEND - A static message that gets prepended onto all check-in or forced check-in messages
VCS_MESSAGE_PREPEND=
#-------------------
6. Edit /resources/modules/VCSModule.xml and LABVCSModule.xml (and any other VCS Module XML files that you have) 
   and add the following line after <VCS_IGNORE_MESSAGES></VCS_IGNORE_MESSAGES>
		<VCS_MESSAGE_PREPEND></VCS_MESSAGE_PREPEND>

Release 2012-01-31:
======================
1) Fixed encryption issue so that <VCS_PASSWORD> in VCSModule.xml gets encrypted.

======================
Release 2012-01-26:
======================
1) Fixed a Perforce issue where the user does not have permissions to delete the link to the workspace on the server.
   Removed the -f flag from the command "p4 client -f -d ${VCS_WORKSPACE_NAME}" and provided a way to pass in
   options from the deploy.properties/studio.properties using P4DEL_LINK_OPTIONS=
2) Added the ability to set VCS configuration properties using the VCSModule.xml instead of deploy.properties.  
   This gives the user the ability to associate different VCS settings like branches/tags in subversion on a single line of the plan file
   instead of environment wide as was done with the deploy.properties file.  Maintained backward compatibility with previous releases.

Section 3:
To Upgrade an existing install:
================================
--------------------------
1. Rename previous release
--------------------------
   1.1) Rename the original PDTool or PDTool62 directory to PDTool62-YYYY-MM-DD

        where YYYY-MM-DD represents the actual release of the previous version as found in PDTool-6.2-YYYY-MM-DD.r1.txt.

----------------------
2. Install new version
----------------------
   2.1) Copy the PDTool zip file with the pattern "PDTool-6.2-YYYY-MM-DD.r1.zip" to the root folder where you want to unzip.

   2.1) OPTION 1: Install the new version by unzipping the PDTool zip file using "WinZip" or "7-Zip"

	If you using Winzip or 7-Zip then select the option to "Extract Here"

	Another option is to leave the zip file where it is and simply browse to the root folder where you want to create the "PDTool62" sub-folder.

   2.2) OPTION 2: Install the new version by unzipping the PDTool zip file using "Extract All"

        If using Windows "Extract All", make sure that you remove the folder name at the end corrensponding with this pattern: \PDTool-6.2-YYYY-MM-DD.r1

	The Extract All will unzip into the root of the directory where the zip file lives and create the sub-folder "PDTool62".

	Another option is to leave the zip file where it is and simply browse to the root folder where you want to create the "PDTool62" sub-folder.

----------------------------
3. Upgrade Module XML Files
----------------------------
   3.1) Save the new PDTool62/resources/modules/*.xml to a sub-folder so these files are not overwritten

   4.3) Edit .dp files as needed or as directed by the release notes to take advantage of new functionality

--------------------------
5. Upgrade Ant Build Files
--------------------------
   5.1) Save the new PDTool62/resources/ant/*.xml to a sub-folder so these files are not overwritten

   5.2) Copy PDTool62-YYYY-MM-DD/resources/ant/*.xml PDTool62/resources/ant

   5.3) Edit .xml files as needed or as directed by the release notes to take advantage of new functionality

---------------------------------------
6. Upgrade Configuration Property Files
---------------------------------------
   6.1) Save the new PDTool62/resources/config/*.* to a sbu-folder so these files are not overwritten

   6.2) Copy PDTool62-YYYY-MM-DD/config/*.properties PDTool62/config

   6.3) Copy PDTool62-YYYY-MM-DD/config/*.xml PDTool62/config

   6.4) Edit .properties files as needed or as directed by the release notes to take advantage of new functionality

--------------------
7. Upgrade bin Files
--------------------

   7.1) Copy any customized batch/shell script files from PDTool62-YYYY-MM-DD/bin to PDTool62/bin

   7.2) Review any differences between the old and new setVars.bat.

        7.2.1) If no differences, simply copy PDTool62-YYYY-MM-DD/bin/setVars.bat or .sh to PDTool62/bin

        7.2.2) If there are differences, then copy your modifications to the same environment variables in the new setVars.bat or .sh
               Open both the old and new setVars.bat and copy the environment variable settings as needed.
